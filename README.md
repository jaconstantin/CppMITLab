C++ exercises from MIT opencourseware

This repository stores the C++ codes that I've written as solution to Lab exercises for the MIT Opencourseware introductory course on C++.
I also added some codes to further explore the different programming concepts of C++.
This exercise is able to cover the entire basics of C++ from pointers, arrays, to class constructors, inheritance, templates, and STL.
